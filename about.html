<h1> About </h1>
<div class="content">
    <p>
            I graduated from UCLA in 2017 with a degree in Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology. 
        As an undergraduate I did research in a computational biology lab. Since then, my interests 
        have shifted more and more from the biological towards the computational - specifically 
        machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
            Post-graduation I enrolled in the Foundations in Computer Science Graduate Program at Stanford. 
        I also began taking additional machine learning courses through Coursera, eventually leading 
        to my current role as a Data Scientist at Brereton, Hanley and Co., a private investment 
        banking firm.
