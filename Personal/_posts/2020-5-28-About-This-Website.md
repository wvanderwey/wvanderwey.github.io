This site has been a long time in the making. It took quite a few drafts before I realized I was spending too much effort on the look of the website when I should have been spending it on the content (using a premade theme instead of doing it all from scratch would have saved a lot of time). In the end, I scrapped most of my more complicated designs for basic HTML and a little CSS, all written using the static site generator Jekyll. Everything is currently hosted for free on GitHub pages.
